# AVL - A machine learning tool to detech phishing URLs

AVL has 2 main parts:
1. **server**: A flask webserver which provide a restful api to fetch an url's information
2. **extension**: A Chrome extension which interact with sharkcop-server to detech phishing URLs

The server will be up at 127.0.0.1:8080. 
The RESTful API endpoint would be in this format:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/check?url=https://abc.xyz
```

You can test the api through a web interface at http://127.0.0.1:8080

There are 2 statuses that could be returned:
-  1 : The url is phishing
-  0 : The url is normal

**2. Setup extension (for Chrome)**

  - Open Chrome Extension Manager (chrome://extensions/)
  - Enable Developer Mode
  - Click 'Load unpacked' and select the directory **'extension'** inside our project root directory
